what are the differences between getServerSideProps, getStaticProps, getStaticProps and getInitialProps in nextjs



answers


getStaticProps


Runs at build time
Page is pre-rendered to HTML + JSON
Fast and SEO-friendly
Canâ€™t access request data


etStaticPaths

Works with getStaticProps for dynamic routes (e.g., /posts/[id])
Tells Next.js which paths to pre-render



getServerSideProps


Runs on the server on each request
Good for real-time or user-specific data
Slower than getStaticProps (since it runs every time)



getInitialProps


Runs on both server (initial load) and client (route changes)
Only works with custom _app.js or older pages
Not recommended in modern apps (use the newer methods instead)
